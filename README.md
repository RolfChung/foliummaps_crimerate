# Summary
<p>
folium makes it easy to visualize data thatâ€™s been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.

<p>
The aim of this projet is to introduce the data visualization capabilities of the Folium library Python as concrete and as consistent as possible. It creates world maps, country maps, regions maps,
maps with markers, and choropleth maps. It sets the markers and color intensity on the map of 
San Francisco along with crime incidents.
